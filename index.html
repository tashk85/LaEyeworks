        <p>Dorothy Parker famously observed, "Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses." How did we go from that image to bespectacled bombshells?</p>

        <p>Judging from the plethora of eye-catching eyewear that's been getting face time over the last few years be it on the ready-to-wear runways or in the adjoining office cubicle it's clear that glasses have gone from nerd necessity to chic accessory. The collections themselves are becoming more elaborate. There are some styles that are like jewelry pieces, that make a big fashion statement.</p>

        <p>It's a shift reflected in the current look-at-me trends, retro, vintage-inspired frames, chunky tortoise shells and geometric shapes that attract rather than deflect attention and reinforced by the laundry list of fashion-focused brands with a presence in the eyewear arena.</p>

        <p>Today the throwback look, dominated by classic shapes and tortoise-shell patterns. Call it vintage-inspired, geek chic or the "Mad Men" effect reigns supreme, while the addition of bright pops of color and unusual shapes make fashion-forward eyewear more eye-catching and image-defining than ever.These include our new high-end ranges with styles to suit everyone. The collections are being treated in a more fashion-forward way.</p>
